MudBlazor 8.x integration with .NET 10\n3. Blazor hosting model decision (Server vs WebAssembly vs Auto)\n\n### **Key Decisions Identified**\n1. **Blazor Hosting Model** - Impacts real-time push capabilities\n2. **Project Structure Pattern** - Single vs multi-project (simplicity principle favors single project)\n\n### **Validation Approach**\n- **Minimal mode** - Just verify project compiles and runs\n- **No security scan** needed at this phase\n- **No staging deployment** required",

MudBlazor Installation:\n   - Package: dotnet add package MudBlazor\n   - Setup: builder.Services.AddMudServices();\n   - Layout: Add MudThemeProvider, MudPopoverProvider, etc.\n\n2. Syncthing Event API (CRITICAL for monitoring):\n   - Endpoint: GET /rest/events?since={lastEventId}\n   - Auth: X-API-Key header or Bearer token\n   - Key Events: DeviceConnected, DeviceDisconnected, FolderCompletion\n   - Pattern: Long polling (server holds connection until events)\n\n3. Real-time UI Architecture:\n   - Blazor Server uses SignalR automatically\n   - No polling needed - StateHasChanged() for UI updates\n   - IHostedService for background monitoring\n\n=== RECOMMENDATIONS ===\n\n1. HIGH: Use .NET 9 now, upgrade to .NET 10 when RTM (Nov 2025)\n2. HIGH: Implement Syncthing monitoring via Events API long polling\n3. HIGH: Use Blazor Server mode for real-time UI\n4. MEDIUM: Use IHostedService for background Syncthing monitoring\n5. MEDIUM: Implement exponential backoff for connection resilience\n\nresearch.json created successfully at:\nC:\\Source\\SixFive7\\SyncthingTemplar\\.auto-claude\\specs\\001-project-setup\\research.json",

Here's what I found:\n\n### Integrations Researched: 5\n\n| Integration | Status | Key Finding |\n|------------|--------|-------------|\n| **MudBlazor** | ✅ Verified | NuGet package `MudBlazor`, requires .NET 9+ SDK |\n| **Syncthing REST/Event API** | ✅ Verified | Long-polling Events API at `/rest/events` - this IS the push-based approach |\n| **Blazor Server** | ✅ Verified | Part of ASP.NET Core, includes SignalR for real-time UI |\n| **.NET 10** | ⚠️ Partial | RTM not released yet (expected Nov 2025) |\n| **SignalR** | ✅ Verified | Included with Blazor Server - no separate install needed |\n\n### Critical Findings\n\n1. **Syncthing Push Protocol Clarified**: Syncthing uses **HTTP Long Polling** for its Events API, not WebSockets. This is effectively push-based - the server holds the connection until events are available. Key endpoints:\n   - `GET /rest/events?since={lastEventId}` - Event stream\n   - Events include: `DeviceConnected`, `DeviceDisconnected`, `FolderCompletion`, etc.\n\n2. **.NET 10 Not Yet Available**: The requirement specifies \".NET 10 RTM\" but this won't be released until November 2025. **Recommendation: Start with .NET 9, upgrade when .NET 10 RTM releases.**\n\n3. **Anti-Polling Architecture Confirmed**: Blazor Server + SignalR provides real-time UI updates without polling. Combined with Syncthing's long-polling Events API, the entire monitoring stack can be push-based.\n\n### Output\n\nCreated `research.json` with:\n- Detailed package information and installation commands\n- API patterns with actual code snippets\n- Configuration requirements\n- Known gotchas and recommendations\n- Architecture insights for the monitoring service",

117→| Blazor Server Config | Research findings | AddInteractiveServerComponents pattern |\n   118→| SignalR Timeouts | Research findings | Connection resilience settings |\n   119→\n   120→## Patterns to Follow\n   121→\n   122→### MudBlazor Provider Setup\n   123→\n   124→Required in `MainLayout.razor`:\n   125→\n   126→```razor\n   127→<MudThemeProvider />\n   128→<MudPopoverProvider />\n   129→<MudDialogProvider />\n   130→<MudSnackbarProvider />\n   131→```\n   132→\n   133→**Key Points:**\n   134→- All four providers must be present for MudBlazor to function correctly\n   135→- Place providers at the root of the layout\n   136→- Theme provider enables dark/light mode switching\n   137→\n   138→### Blazor Server Configuration\n   139→\n   140→In `Program.cs`:\n   141→\n   142→```csharp\n   143→builder.Services.AddRazorComponents()\n   144→    .AddInteractiveServerComponents();\n   145→\n   146→builder.Services.AddMudServices();\n   147→\n   148→// ... app configuration ...\n   149→\n   150→app.MapRazorComponents<App>()\n   151→    .AddInteractiveServerRenderMode();\n   152→```\n   153→\n   154→**Key Points:**\n   155→- Use Interactive Server Components for real-time updates\n   156→- MudServices must be registered in DI container\n   157→- SignalR is automatically configured with Blazor Server\n   158→\n   159→### Simple Code Pattern (ENFORCED)\n   160→\n   161→All code must follow these readability principles:\n   162→\n   163→```csharp\n   164→// GOOD: Clear, simple, traceable\n   165→public class ServerService\n   166→{\n   167→    private readonly List<SyncthingServer> _servers = new();\n   168→\n   169→    public IReadOnlyList<SyncthingServer> GetServers() => _servers;\n   170→\n   171→    public void AddServer(SyncthingServer server) => _servers.Add(server);\n   172→}\n   173→\n   174→// BAD: Over-engineered, hard to follow\n   175→public class ServerService<TServer, TRepository>\n   176→    where TServer : IServer\n   177→    where TRepository : IRepository<TServer>\n   178→{\n   179→    // ... complex generic patterns\n   180→}\n   181→```\n   182→\n   183→**Key Points:**\n   184→- Prefer explicit over implicit\n   185→- Avoid deep abstraction hierarchies\n   186→- Methods should do one thing clearly\n   187→- Variable names should be self-documenting\n   188→\n   189→## Requirements\n   190→\n   191→### Functional Requirements\n   192→\n   193→1. **Project Builds and Runs**\n   194→   - Description: Solution compiles without errors and application starts\n   195→   - Acceptance: `dotnet build` succeeds, `dotnet run` starts web server\n   196→\n   197→2. **MudBlazor Renders Correctly**\n   198→   - Description: MudBlazor components display with proper styling\n   199→   - Acceptance: Home page shows MudBlazor-styled content\n   200→\n   201→3. **Navigation Works**\n   202→   - Description: User can navigate between all placeholder pages\n   203→   - Acceptance: Clicking nav items routes to correct pages\n   204→\n   205→4. **Responsive Layout**\n   206→   - Description: Layout adapts to different screen sizes\n   207→   - Acceptance: MudDrawer collapses on mobile, expands on desktop\n   208→\n   209→5. **Dark Mode Support**\n   210→   - Description: Application supports dark/light theme toggle\n   211→   - Acceptance: Theme can be toggled via settings\n   212→\n   213→### Non-Functional Requirements\n   214→\n   215→1. **Code Simplicity**\n   216→   - All code follows \"simple mental patterns\" principle\n   217→   - No over-engineering or premature abstraction\n   218→\n   219→2. **Modern .NET Patterns**\n   220→   - Use latest C# features appropriately\n   221→   - Follow .NET 9 conventions and best practices\n   222→\n   223→3. **No Polling Architecture**\n   224→   - Foundation set for push-based updates\n   225→   - No setInterval or Timer-based UI refresh patterns\n   226→\n   227→### Edge Cases\n   228→\n   229→1. **Browser Refresh** - SignalR reconnects automatically (Blazor Server default)\n   230→2. **Network Interruption** - Blazor handles circuit disconnection with retry UI\n   231→3. **Multiple Tabs** - Each tab maintains independent circuit (standard behavior)\n   232→\n   233→## Implementation Notes\n   234→\n   235→### DO\n   236→- Use `@rendermode InteractiveServer` for interactive components\n   237→- Follow MudBlazor component naming conventions (MudButton, MudCard, etc.)\n   238→- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility)\n   239→- Use MudThemeProvider for consistent theming\n   240→- Structure folders by feature (Servers/, Monitoring/, Settings/)\n   241→- Add XML documentation comments for public APIs\n   242→\n   243→### DON'T\n   244→- Create abstract base classes \"just in case\"\n   245→- Use complex generic constraints unnecessarily\n   246→- Implement repository pattern for this initial setup (premature)\n   247→- Add polling mecha\n\n...

This app should have a web interface on which one can add and configure servers, add auth creds for them, setup what should be monitored for each server and who will be notified if monitoring detects issues. Thing to monitor are some basics, like is the server online, but also more syncthing specific things like if a specific instance has remote syncthing nodes that have been offline for more than x time. All monitoring for syncthing stats should be coded in such a way that they leverage the push based protocol available (the same as used between syncthing and the its own gui).\\nThe app should be based on .net 10 RTM with all the latest .NET code patterns. It should at all times be aggressively designed to be coded in such a way that someone reading the code can follow along using simple mental patterns. Encode and enforce this rule also for future tasks. Furthermore the app should be a c# .net 10 blazor app using blazor and mudblazor for a beautifull reactive UI. At all times should we try to prevent polling.

Here's what was accomplished:\n\n### Files Created/Updated\n\n| File | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `implementation_plan.json` | Complete subtask-based implementation plan with 6 phases and 14 subtasks |\n| `project_index.json` | Updated with service configuration (web app + test project) |\n| `context.json` | Updated with files to create and critical patterns |\n| `init.sh` | Development environment setup script |\n| `build-progress.txt` | Progress tracking document |\n\n### Implementation Plan Structure\n\n```\nPhase 1: Project Scaffolding (2 subtasks)\n  └─ Create solution, project file, directory structure\n\nPhase 2: Core Configuration (4 subtasks) ← depends on Phase 1\n  └─ Program.cs, appsettings.json, App.razor, Routes.razor, _Imports.razor\n\nPhase 3: Layout and Navigation (2 subtasks) ← depends on Phase 2\n  └─ MainLayout.razor with MudBlazor providers, NavMenu.razor\n\nPhase 4: Placeholder Pages (4 subtasks) ← depends on Phase 3\n  └─ Home, Servers, Monitoring, Settings pages\n  \nPhase 5: Test Project Setup (1 subtask) ← depends on Phase 1 [parallel with 2-4]\n  └─ xUnit test project\n\nPhase 6: End-to-End Verification (3 subtasks) ← depends on Phase 4+5\n  └─ Build verification, runtime testing, navigation testing\n```\n\n### Key Technical Decisions\n\n| Decision | Choice | Rationale |\n|----------|--------|-----------|\n| Framework | .NET 9 | Latest stable release (not .NET 10 preview) |\n| UI Framework | Blazor Server | Real-time SignalR updates, no polling |\n| UI Library | MudBlazor | Beautiful reactive components |\n| Architecture | Push-based | No polling anywhere - event-driven design |\n| Code Style | Simplicity-first | Explicit over implicit, no premature abstractions |\n\n### Critical Implementation Requirements\n\n1. **MudBlazor Providers**: All four providers MUST be in MainLayout.razor:\n   - `<MudThemeProvider />`\n   - `<MudPopoverProvider />`\n   - `<MudDialogProvider />`\n   - `<MudSnackbarProvider />`\n\n2. **No Polling Patterns**: Explicitly banned patterns:\n   - `Timer`, `PeriodicTimer`\n   - `setInterval`, `setTimeout` for refresh\n\n3. **Blazor Server Config**: Required in Program.cs:\n   ```csharp\n   builder.Services.AddRazorComponents().AddInteractiveServerComponents();\n   builder.Services.AddMudServices();\n   ```\n\n### Next Steps\n\nTo continue building this spec, the coder agent should:\n\n```bash\nsource auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 001 --parallel 1\n```\n\n**PLANNING COMPLETE - Ready for Coder Agent**",

Additionally, the Program.cs references `SyncthingTemplar.Components.App` which will be created in **subtask-2-3**. Full build verification will succeed once App.razor is created.\n\n### Quality Checklist:\n- ✅ Follows patterns from spec (AddRazorComponents pattern, AddMudServices)\n- ✅ No console.log/print debugging statements\n- ✅ Error handling in place (UseExceptionHandler for non-dev)\n- ⏳ Verification deferred (requires App.razor from subtask-2-3)\n- ✅ Clean commit with descriptive message",

  "task_description": "Create the basic project structure for my app. It will be a monitoring application for multiple syncthing instances. The usecase is for people hosting one or more synchting servers either on multiple servers or inside multiple containers. This app should have a web interface on which one can add and configure servers, add auth creds for them, setup what should be monitored for each server and who will be notified if monitoring detects issues. Thing to monitor are some basics, like is the server online, but also more syncthing specific things like if a specific instance has remote syncthing nodes that have been offline for more than x time. All monitoring for syncthing stats should be coded in such a way that they leverage the push based protocol available (the same as used between syncthing and the its own gui).\nThe app should be based on .net 10 RTM with all the latest .NET code patterns. It should at all times be aggressively designed to be coded in such a way that someone reading the code can follow along using simple mental patterns. Encode and enforce this rule also for future tasks. Furthermore the app should be a c# .net 10 blazor app using blazor and mudblazor for a beautifull reactive UI. At all times should we try to prevent polling. The gui should be very beautifull but the code should remain simple.\n\nBTW: .NET 10 and all it's tooling is definitively release.
